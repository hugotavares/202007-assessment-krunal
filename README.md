# 202007-assessment-krunal

## Goal

Implement vertical parallax effect for MK, with at least 2 images/labels, as per shared documention.

## Tasks

1. Setup locally git.
2. Define the tools and products to implement the parallax effect.
3. Outline the instructions to deploy the solution (can be updated while the assessment is running).
4. Commit and push the changes to this repo on a regular basis, with clear comments so that anyone can understand the progress.
5. Report on the progress having in mind the checkpoints:
  * checkpoint 1: July 26th;
  * checkpoint 2: July 28th;
  * final checkpoint: July 30th.
6. The **dead line** for the delivery of the solution is **July 30th, 19:00 BST / 23:30 IST**.

## Evaluation 

Your solution will be evaluated taking into account:

* Modularity and readability of the  code;
* Smart usage of the frameworks and clean code practices;
* Design skills, both in terms of code and in visual terms;
* Documentation (it does not have to be a lot, but it has to be enough for anyone can deploy and maintain the solution);
* Regular commits and pushes to the master branch (we suggest you do it on a daily basis), as well as the clarity of the commit messages;
* Communication and progress reports: if you need more time please warn us, if you have doubts please email us, use our availability.
  
  
## Assessment guidelines

At WLP we emphasize simple solutions, that do not depend in a lot in tool/product integration and complex desings. Also, since the company is driven by an Agile mindset, communication is key. So you will be assessed on:

* Quality of delivered work: this means that you implemented the expected requirement. (E.g.: try to start from scratch yourself and don't spend too much time customizing something that is not meant to do the job in the first place... You'll lose a lot of time and, probably, the opportunity to show your awesome skills.)
* Simplicity of the solution: think of something that must be used/reworked later by someone, that includes you or anyone who can be on-boarded in the feature. (E.g.: don't spend time in implementing a Angular 8 app when what you just need is to implement a banner.)
* Mindful communication: again, we are Agile, so this means we need to articulate often, whether via email or Git or even the management board. It is better for everyone to have all the information than only a few bits, thus communicating effectively is something we value at WLP. (For instance: regularly pushing code to git repo with clear and informative comments is standard that we want to keep.)
